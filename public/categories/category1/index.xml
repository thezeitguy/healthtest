      <description>&lt;p&gt;**The Federal Government&amp;rsquo;s new health care home model for people living with chronic conditions will be rolled out across 10 regions from 2017.&lt;br /&gt;
South Eastern Melbourne&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;laquo;The Health Care Homes model has to work for rural and remote communities. This has to work equally as well&lt;br /&gt;
for the patient living in Thargomindah as it does for the patient living in inner-city Sydney.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;laquo;The model must be flexible enough to meet the unique needs of small rural and remote communities. And it&lt;br /&gt;
must reflect the fact that the provision of healthcare works differently in rural and remote areas than it does in&lt;br /&gt;
urban settings.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;laquo;A Health Care Homes approach to chronic care is something that RDAA has been calling for and strongly&lt;br /&gt;
supports, but it must improve access to care for rural and remote Australians&lt;/p&gt;
