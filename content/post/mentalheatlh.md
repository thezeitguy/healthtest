**The Federal Government's new health care home model for people living with chronic conditions will be rolled out across 10 regions from 2017.

"The Health Care Homes model has to work for rural and remote communities. This has to work equally as well
for the patient living in Thargomindah as it does for the patient living in inner-city Sydney.
"The model must be flexible enough to meet the unique needs of small rural and remote communities. And it
must reflect the fact that the provision of healthcare works differently in rural and remote areas than it does in
urban settings.
"A Health Care Homes approach to chronic care is something that RDAA has been calling for and strongly
supports, but it must improve access to care for rural and remote Australians
